# Schematics

## Overview

Schematics were built using KiCad: https://www.kicad.org/

It's free, open source, and for my purposes worked very well.

If I had my time back, I would have learned to use this *at the start*, or at least as I was working through the build. I tracked wire mappings and pinouts using a giant 700+ row spreadsheet. And, although that worked for me, it would have been way easier to troubleshoot had I just used the *right tool for the job* (e.g. KiCad).

The **Main** folder includes the main schematics for the actual build. 

The **Tooling** folding includes some additial schematics for things like the EEPROM and RAM programmers.

## Reading These With KiCad

Go get KiCad: https://www.kicad.org/

If you double-click on the `Main.kicad_pro` that'll open up the main build, and you can navigate through the schematics - it doesn't take much to learn how to crawl around these files. You can also open up individual schematics by double-clicking any `*.kicad_sch` file (e.g. `RAM Programmer.kicad_sch`).

## PDF Versions

I've included a few PDFs in the `schematics` folder. If you don't have or don't want to use KiCad, these can be used to review/map the build as well.
